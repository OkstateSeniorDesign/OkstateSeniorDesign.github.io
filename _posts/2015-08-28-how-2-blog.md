##All about Blogging 

###To create a blog

    git clone https://github.com/OkstateSeniorDesign/OkstateSeniorDesign.github.io.git
    cd OkstateSeniorDesign.github.io
    rake post title="Insert your title here"
    cd _posts
    
Edit the post with the name you just created
These post are in markdown format meaning you can do cool stuff like [this](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

At the top of the file there are a couple things

    ---
    layout: post
    title: "First Post"
    description: "First Post in the Blog"
    category:
    tags: []
    ---
    
Leave all that there.

In the category give it something like Daily Blog, or Part find or Update or all of the above

In the tag use your name, so they can be sorted very easily later

All this documentation can be found [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [here](http://jekyllrb.com/)

##When to create a blog
These are meant to be daily updates to the website as to track our progress
The more often you update these the better documentation I will have when I go put together the documentation at the end
