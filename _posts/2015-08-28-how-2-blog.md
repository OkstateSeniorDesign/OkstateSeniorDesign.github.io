###Install Requirements

To get the automatic page building up and running you need to install a few things

[Ruby](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.1/ruby-2.1.7.tar.gz)

[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-2.4.8.tgz)

If you are wanting to test page the locally you must also install

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/x64/node-v0.12.7-x64.msi)

###Get everything running

Once all the above is installed then you must install jekyll

    gem install jekyll

####Create a new post

    rake post title="Insert you name here"

####Create a page
    rake page name="pageName.md"
    
Create a nested page

    rake page name="pages/pageName.md"
    
Create a page with a "pretty" path

    rake page name="pages/about"
    # this will create the file: ./pages/about/index.html

###Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/OkstateSeniorDesign/OkstateSeniorDesign.github.io.git
    cd OkstateSeniorDesign.github.io

####Create your post

Leave all that there.

In the category give it something like Daily Blog, or Part find or Update or all of the above

In the tag use your name, so they can be sorted very easily later

All this documentation can be found [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [here](http://jekyllrb.com/)

##When to create a blog
These are meant to be daily updates to the website as to track our progress
The more often you update these the better documentation I will have when I go put together the documentation at the end
