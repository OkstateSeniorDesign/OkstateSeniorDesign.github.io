Leave all that there.

In the category give it something like Daily Blog, or Part find or Update or all of the above

In the tag use your name, so they can be sorted very easily later

All this documentation can be found [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [here](http://jekyllrb.com/)

##When to create a blog
These are meant to be daily updates to the website as to track our progress
The more often you update these the better documentation I will have when I go put together the documentation at the end
